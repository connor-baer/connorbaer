When I started [UWC Blogs](https://uwcblogs.com/) in 2013, my intention was to give UWC applicants a glimpse into life at UWC. At the time I was waiting impatiently to start my own UWC experience at [UWC Waterford Kamhlaba](https://uwcblogs.com/#waterford-kamhlaba-uwc). I had soaked up every bit of UWC promotional material, but I still couldn’t quite imagine what UWC would be like. So I read through every blog about UWC I could find and eventually created UWC Blogs to share my list of blogs with other UWC hopefuls.

Now UWC Blogs has grown to include over 440 blogs. That’s a lot of content!
