              My roots lie in the field of design, however I ultimately found my
              passion in programming. The approach I take to my work is fun,
              fearless, and always forward-looking. My goal is to make
              technology more human.

              Technology should serve and delight its users without getting in
              the way. I always optimise for accessibility, usability, and
              performance to craft intuitive digital experiences for everyone.
